This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception. This error occurs when a value is assigned to a variable that falls outside the defined range of its subtype.  The example shows how a seemingly simple increment operation can trigger this error if not carefully handled.  The solution illustrates proper error handling and range checking.
